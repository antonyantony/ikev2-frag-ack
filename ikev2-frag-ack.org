#+begin_abstract
This document specifies an extension to the Internet Key Exchange
Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) that enables acknowledgment of IKEv2
message fragments over UDP.  The mechanism allows an IKE peer to
confirm reception of individual fragments during the IKE_AUTH exchange
and any subsequent exchanges where IKEv2 Fragmentation is used.
Support for this feature is negotiated using a new Notify Message
Status Type during IKE_SA_INIT, and fragment acknowledgments are
exchanged using a separate Notification payload.  This extension
improves reliability when large IKE messages are exchanged, such as
those containing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) payloads, and reduces
retransmission overhead, thereby improving IKEv2 round-trip times in
lossy network conditions.

* Introduction

The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [[RFC7296]] uses
an unreliable transport (UDP) for message exchange.

Originally, IKEv2 messages were small — typically a few hundred bytes
to a few kilobytes — such that a simple fragmentation [[RFC7383]] and
retransmission mechanism operating over UDP, without congestion control
or partial acknowledgments, was practically sufficient.  However, with
the introduction of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms into
IKEv2 [[RFC9370]], IKE peers are now required to exchange much larger
messages than those produced by classical algorithms, often tens of
kilobytes and sometimes approaching 64 kilobytes in size.

There are also several proposals to extend IKEv2 beyond the 64-kilobyte
payload limitation [[I-D.nir-ipsecme-big-payload]],
 [[I-D.smyslov-ipsecme-ikev2-extended-pld]],
 [[I-D.tjhai-ikev2-beyond-64k-limit]].

In the current IKEv2 fragmentation mechanism [[RFC7383]], when one or
more fragments are lost, the sender retransmits all fragments of the
message.  Practical experience shows that this can lead to significant
retransmission overhead and long delays when large fragmented messages
are exchanged.  In some chronic cases, peers may fail to establish an
IKE SA even after dozens of retransmissions.  This document proposes a
fragment acknowledgment mechanism for IKEv2, similar in concept to
acknowledgment schemes used in QUIC [[RFC9000]].

When both the responder and initiator support the new IKEv2 Fragment
Acknowledgment, the initiator retransmits only the fragments
that the responder reports as missing, reducing bandwidth consumption
and latency overhead.

The current IKEv2 retransmission model is entirely initiator-driven:
only the initiator can decide when to retransmit a message after a
timeout [[RFC7383]]. The responder has no means to request
retransmission or to signal that it has received an incomplete set of
fragments.  This document proposes to extend that model slightly by
allowing the responder, upon receiving one or more fragments of an

IKE message and detecting that some fragments are missing, to send a
IKEv2 response, of the same exchange with Fragment Acknowledgment
notification indicating the missing fragments. This message is sent
with the IKEv2 Response flag set.  It does not require a response,
does not advance the IKEv2 Message ID state.

IKE message and detecting that some fragments are missing, to send a
single, Fragment Acknowledgment notification indicating the missing
fragments.  This message is sent  with IKEv2 flag Response and
do not require a response and it does not advance the IKEv2 Message
ID state. And also this message MAY not be retransmitted

** Terminology

This document uses the following terms defined in [[RFC7296]]:
IKE_SA_INIT, IKE_AUTH, CREATE_CHILD_SA, SK_e, SK_a.

This document also uses the following terms defined in [[RFC9242]]:
IKE_INTERMEDIATE.

This document also uses the following terms defined in [[RFC7383]]:
IKEv2 Fragmentation, Total Fragments,

* Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

* FRAGMENT_ACK Notify Message Status Type payload

The Fragment Acknowledgment Notifier, FRAGMENT_ACK, is primarily
useful during IKE_AUTH, IKE_INTERMEDIATE, and CREATE_CHILD_SA
exchanges. During IKE_AUTH and IKE_INTERMEDIATE, peer authentication
may still be incomplete.  In these exchanges, fragments are already
protected by encryption and integrity using SK_e and SK_a, which
must have been derived but not yet authenticated.  The format of
the fragment header is specified in [[RFC7383]].

- Protocol ID (1 octet) - MUST be 0.  MUST be ignored if not 0.
- SPI Size (1 octet) - MUST be 0.  MUST be ignored if not 0.
- Notify Status Message Type value (2 octets) - set to TBD2.
- Pairs of ACK # and Range

The payload enumerates  a set of received fragments for a single IKE
message. The ACK # field indicates the highest fragment received from
the total number of fragments, and the Range # field indicates the
contiguous range of acknowledged fragments.
It enables selective retransmission of only the missing
fragments by the sender. The Total Fragments field is part of each
fragment header, as defined in [[RFC7383]], Section 2.5.

** Sending Fragment Acknowledgment response

The responder MAY send a response to an exchange with Fragment
Acknowledgment notification after receiving one or more fragments
of a request. See [[ike-intermediate-request]]. Similarly, the
initiator MAY send a Fragment Acknowledgment notification after
receiving one or more fragments of a response. See [[ike-intermediate-response]].

When the initiator sends a FRAGMENT_ACK notification in
response to a fragmented response, it would need to set the IKE
header Response flag (R) bit. This results in a
"response to a response" that uses the same Message ID, which is
somewhat unusual in IKEv2 message flow. [NOTE: Other solutions?]

** Processing Fragment Acknowledgment Message

Unlike typical IKEv2 exchanges, which complete when a response with the
matching Message ID arrives, Fragment Acknowledgment notification do not
indicate completion of the exchange.  Instead, this message requests
retransmission of the missing fragments and MUST NOT advance the IKEv2
Message ID counter.

When the sender retransmits in response to a Fragment Acknowledgment,
it SHOULD begin with the lowest missing fragment.  (See editor’s note
below regarding potential use of INFORMATIONAL exchanges.)

* Negotiation
The use of Fragment Acknowledgment MUST be negotiated during the
IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  Both the initiator and the responder indicate
support for this extension by including the
FRAGMENT_ACK_SUPPORTED Notify Message Status Type (value TBD1)
in the IKE_SA_INIT request and response messages.  The presence of
this notification in both directions confirms that both peers support
the Fragment Acknowledgment mechanism.

If either peer omits the FRAGMENT_ACK_SUPPORTED notification in
IKE_SA_INIT the extension MUST NOT be used in subsequent exchanges
within that IKE SA.

The FRAGMENT_ACK_SUPPORTED notification follows the general rules for
Notify Message Status Types as specified in [[RFC7296]], Section 3.10.
It does not include any data in the Notification Data field.

* Backward Compatibility

Receipt of a FRAGMENT_ACK notification MUST NOT be interpreted as
advancing the IKEv2 exchange state. Instead it is signal to retransmit only the missing fragments.

* Operational Considerations

The FRAGMENT_ACK notifcation message SHOULD NOT be large enough to cause
path-MTU issues. If the number of acknowledged fragments results in a
payload that approaches the path MTU or IKEv2 Fragemnet size
, the sender MAY limit the number of fragment ranges included in
a single message and send multiple FRAGMENT_ACK messages if
necessary. Implementations SHOULD ensure that each FRAGMENT_ACK
message fits within a single UDP datagram to avoid IP-layer
fragmentation.

* Editors Notes Open Issues

- Path MTU discovery mentioned in [[RFC7383]] is currently ignored;
  applicability TBD.
- When fragments exceed the path MTU, they may not be acknowledged,
  and the IKE state will not advance. This will have re-fragmented
	as specified in [[RFC7383]]
- Why not use IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL? That may adhere more to IKEv2.
  However, every INFORMATIONAL needs a response. And if there is no
  response the INFORMATIONAL message might be retransmitted this would
  lead to complex unpredictable retransmissions.
- Why not make new IKEv2 exchange without a response? Instead of
  responding to the same : responding with IKE_AUTH or IKE_INTERMEDIATE
	this is worth considering. New Exchange IKE_FRAG_ACK : which has no
	response. The message will carry IKE exchange and message ID it is
	responding to. This might be bigger change. This will bigger protocol
	change.

** New Exchange: IKE_FRAG_ACK

A possible design alternative is to define a new IKEv2 exchange type,
IKE_FRAG_ACK, which carries fragment acknowledgment information but
does not have a response.  Each IKE_FRAG_ACK message would include
the Exchange Type and Message ID of the IKE message it acknowledges.
This exchange has no response specified. It is one shot message.
This approach would decouple fragment acknowledgment from existing IKE
exchanges such as IKE_AUTH, IKE_INTERMEDIATE or CREATE_CHILD_SA.

** Why not TCP
Reliable transport for IKEv2 over TCP, as proposed in
[[I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-reliable-transport]], adds implementation
complexity and resource cost.  It requires maintaining both TCP and
UDP sockets, increasing energy use on low-powered devices.  Using TCP
for IKE while keeping ESP in UDP mode through NAT gateways introduces
additional state and resource requirements.  It may also be less
compatible with hardware offloading and inefficient for low-power or
mobile platforms.

Antony's position is that using TCP for IKEv2 is not an ideal
solution for improving reliability.  While a UDP based ideas
borrowed from QUIC-based could provide reliable transport and
may be one day congestion control!
It would be complex for the limited goal of fragment acknowledgment
and selective retransmission. Other authors may have different views
on this topic.

** IV reuse when using AEAD

One potential implementation issue I can see with these ACKs is the IV
when using AEAD.  Both the request and the response use the same message
ID as the actual messages more than once. If the MID is used as IV
this would lead to resuse of IV. Which MUST be avoided.

** Discrepancy with RFC 7383 (IKEv2 fragmentation):

With FRAGMENT_ACK response, a retransmission would not include the first
fragment as required by [[RFC7383]].  May be add retransmissions should include
the First Fragment?

* IANA Considerations

This document defines one new registration for the IANA
"IKEv2 Notify Message Status Types" registry.
