                IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment Extension
         draft-antony-ipsecme-ikev2-fragment-acknowledgment-01

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the Internet Key Exchange
   Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) that defines a mechanism for
   acknowledgment of IKEv2 message Fragments over UDP.  The mechanism
   allows the receiving peer to confirm reception of individual
   fragments during the IKE_AUTH exchange and subsequent exchanges.  As
   a result, the IKEv2 initiator needs to retransmit only the fragments
   that the responder reports as missing.  This improves reliability
   when large IKE messages are exchanged, such as those containing post-
   quantum cryptography (PQC) payloads, and reduces retransmission
   overhead, thereby improving IKEv2 round-trip times in lossy networks.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296] uses
   an unreliable transport (UDP) for message exchange.

   Originally, IKEv2 messages were small — typically a few hundred bytes
   to a few kilobytes — such that a simple fragmentation [RFC7383] and
   retransmission mechanism operating over UDP, without congestion
   control or partial acknowledgments, was practically sufficient.
   However, with the introduction of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)
   algorithms into IKEv2 [RFC9370], IKE peers are now required to
   exchange much larger messages than those produced by classical
   algorithms, often tens of kilobytes and sometimes approaching 64
   kilobytes in size.

   There are also several proposals to extend IKEv2 beyond the
   64-kilobyte payload limitation ([I-D.nir-ipsecme-big-payload], [I-
   D.smyslov-ipsecme-ikev2-extended-pld], [I-D.tjhai-ikev2-beyond-64k-
   limit]).

Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment         October 2025


   In the current IKEv2 fragmentation mechanism [RFC7383], when one or
   more fragments are lost, the sender retransmits all fragments of the
   message.  Practical experience shows that this can lead to
   significant retransmission overhead and long delays when large
   fragmented messages are exchanged.  In some chronic cases, peers may
   fail to establish an IKE SA even after dozens of retransmissions.
   This document proposes a fragment acknowledgment mechanism for IKEv2,
   similar in concept to acknowledgment schemes used in QUIC [RFC9000].

   When both the responder and initiator support the new IKEv2 Fragment
   Acknowledgment message, the initiator retransmits only the fragments
   that the responder reports as missing, reducing bandwidth consumption
   and latency overhead.

   The current IKEv2 retransmission model is entirely initiator-driven:
   only the initiator can decide when to retransmit a message after a
   timeout [RFC7383].  The responder has no means to request
   retransmission or to signal that it has received an incomplete set of
   fragments.  This document proposes to extend that model slightly by
   allowing the responder, upon receiving one or more fragments of an
   IKE message and detecting that some fragments are missing, to send a
   single, Fragemnet Acknowledgment message indicating the missing
   fragments.  This message does not require a response and does not
   advance the IKEv2 Message ID state.  And also this message MAY not be
   retransmtted

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC7296]:

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment

   The Fragment Acknowledgment mechanism is primarily useful during
   IKE_AUTH, IKE_INTERMEDIATE, and CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges.  During
   IKE_AUTH and IKE_INTERMEDIATE, peer authentication may still be
   incomplete.  In IKE_AUTH, fragments are cryptographically protected,
   and SK_a and SK_e must already be derived.  The format of the
   fragment header is specified in [RFC7383].

   The payload enumerates a set of received fragments for a single IKE
   message.  ACK # indicates highest fragment received from from Total
   Fragments.  And thr Range # indicate contigous fragments
   acknowledging.  It enables selective retransmission of only the
   missing fragments by the sender.  The Total Fragments field is part
   of each fragment header, as defined in [RFC7383], Section 2.5.

3.1.  Sending Fragment Acknowledgment Message

   Only the IKE exchange responder sends this message.  It may send an
   acknowledgment after receiving any fragment of a message.

3.2.  Processing Fragment Acknowledgment Message

   Unlike typical IKEv2 exchanges, which complete when a response with
   the matching Message ID arrives, Fragment Acknowledgment messages do
   not indicate completion of the exchange.  Instead, this message
   requests retransmission of the missing fragments and MUST NOT advance
   the IKEv2 Message ID.

   When the sender retransmits in response to a Fragment Acknowledgment,
   it SHOULD begin with the lowest missing fragment.  (See editor’s note
   below regarding potential use of INFORMATIONAL exchanges.)

4.  Backward Compatibility

   Receipt of a Fragment Acknowledgment message MUST NOT be interpreted
   as advancing the IKEv2 exchange state.

   Implementations that do not recognize this payload will ignore it and
   continue using full-message retransmission, preserving backward
   compatibility.

5.  Editors Notes Open Issues

   *  Congestion control mechanisms such as TCP slow start are out of
      scope.

   *  Path MTU discovery mentioned in [RFC7383] is currently ignored;
      applicability TBD.

   *  When fragments exceed the path MTU, they may not be acknowledged,
      and the IKE state will not advance.  This will have re-fragmented
      as in [RFC7383]

   *  Why not use IKEv2 INFORMATIONL?  That would adhere more to IKEv2.
      However, every INFORMATIONL need a response.  And if there is no
      response the INFORMATIONL message might be retransmtted this would
      lead to complex unpredictable retransmissions.

   *  Why not make new IKEv2 exchange without a response?  Instead of
      responding to the same : responding with IKE_AUTH or
      IKE_INTERMEDIATE this is worth considering.  New Exchange
      IKE_FRAG_ACK : which has no response.  The message will carry IKE
      exchange and message ID it is responding to.  This might be bigger
      change.  This will bigger protocol change.

5.1.  New Exchange: IKE_FRAG_ACK

   A possible design alternative is to define a new IKEv2 exchange type,
   IKE_FRAG_ACK, which carries fragment acknowledgment information but
   does not have a response.  Each IKE_FRAG_ACK message would include
   the Exchange Type and Message ID of the IKE message it acknowledges.
   This exchange has no response specified.  It is one shot message.
   This approach would decouple fragment acknowledgment from existing
   IKE exchanges such as IKE_AUTH, IKE_INTERMEDIATE or CREATE_CHILD_SA.

5.2.  Why not TCP

   Reliable transport for IKEv2 over TCP, as proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-reliable-transport], adds implementation
   complexity and resource cost.  It requires maintaining both a TCP and
   UDP sockets, increasing energy use on low-powered devices.  Using TCP
   for IKE while keeping ESP in UDP mode through NAT gateways introduces
   additional state and resource requirements.  It may also be less
   friendly to hardware offloading and inefficient for low-power or
   mobile devices.  Antony personally is strong believer: TCP is not the
   best solution here:) While QUIC would be overdoing it just get
   Fragment ack and congestion control.
