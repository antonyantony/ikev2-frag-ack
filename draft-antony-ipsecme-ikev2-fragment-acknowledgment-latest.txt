                IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment Extension
         draft-antony-ipsecme-ikev2-fragment-acknowledgment-02

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the Internet Key Exchange
   Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) that enables acknowledgment of IKEv2
   message fragments over UDP.  The mechanism allows an IKE peer to
   confirm reception of individual fragments during the IKE_AUTH
   exchange and any subsequent exchanges where IKEv2 Fragmentation is
   used.  Support for this feature is negotiated using a new Notify
   Message Status Type during IKE_SA_INIT, and fragment acknowledgments
   are exchanged using a separate Notification payload.  This extension
   improves reliability when large IKE messages are exchanged, such as
   those containing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) payloads, and
   reduces retransmission overhead, thereby improving IKEv2 round-trip
   times in lossy network conditions.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296] uses
   an unreliable transport (UDP) for message exchange.

   Originally, IKEv2 messages were small — typically a few hundred bytes
   to a few kilobytes — such that a simple fragmentation [RFC7383] and
   retransmission mechanism operating over UDP, without congestion
   control or partial acknowledgments, was practically sufficient.
   However, with the introduction of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)
   algorithms into IKEv2 [RFC9370], IKE peers are now required to
   exchange much larger messages than those produced by classical
   algorithms, often tens of kilobytes and sometimes approaching 64
   kilobytes in size.

Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment        December 2025


   There are also several proposals to extend IKEv2 beyond the
   64-kilobyte payload limitation [I-D.nir-ipsecme-big-payload],
   [I-D.smyslov-ipsecme-ikev2-extended-pld],
   [I-D.tjhai-ikev2-beyond-64k-limit].

   In the current IKEv2 fragmentation mechanism [RFC7383], when one or
   more fragments are lost, the sender retransmits all fragments of the
   message.  Practical experience shows that this can lead to
   significant retransmission overhead and long delays when large
   fragmented messages are exchanged.  In some chronic cases, peers may
   fail to establish an IKE SA even after dozens of retransmissions.
   This document proposes a fragment acknowledgment mechanism for IKEv2,
   similar in concept to acknowledgment schemes used in QUIC [RFC9000].

   When both the responder and initiator support the new IKEv2 Fragment
   Acknowledgment, the initiator retransmits only the fragments that the
   responder reports as missing, reducing bandwidth consumption and
   latency overhead.

   The current IKEv2 retransmission model is entirely initiator-driven:
   only the initiator can decide when to retransmit a message after a
   timeout [RFC7383].  The responder has no means to request
   retransmission or to signal that it has received an incomplete set of
   fragments.  This document proposes to extend that model slightly by
   allowing the responder, upon receiving one or more fragments of an

   IKE message and detecting that some fragments are missing, to send an
   IKEv2 response, of the same exchange with Fragment Acknowledgment
   notification indicating the missing fragments.  This message is sent
   with the IKEv2 Response flag set.  It does not require a response,
   does not advance the IKEv2 Message ID state.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Fragment Acknowledgment Notify Message Status Type payload

   Two Notify Message Status Types are defined: FRAGMENT_ACK_REQ, which
   acknowledges fragments of an IKE request, and FRAGMENT_ACK_RES, which
   acknowledges fragments of an IKE response.

   The Fragment Acknowledgment notifiers (FRAGMENT_ACK_REQ and
   FRAGMENT_ACK_RES) are primarily useful during the IKE_AUTH,
   IKE_INTERMEDIATE, and CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges.  During IKE_AUTH and
   IKE_INTERMEDIATE, peer authentication may still be incomplete, but
   the fragments themselves are protected by encryption and integrity
   using SK_e and SK_a, which have been derived but not yet
   authenticated.  The format of the fragment header is specified in
   [RFC7383].

   Using two distinct notifiers makes the direction of acknowledgment
   explicit, avoiding ambiguity in cases of simultaneous exchanges or
   delayed delivery where multiple messages share the same Message ID.

   The payload enumerates the set of missing fragments for a single IKE

   fragment, and the Missing # field specifies the contiguous range of
   additional missing fragments.  This allows the sender to selectively

Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment        December 2025


   retransmit only those fragments that have not been received.  The
   Total Fragments field is present in each fragment header, as defined
   in [RFC7383], Section 2.5.  For example: 4,4; 7,10; and so on.

   FRFRAGMENT_ACK_RESAGMENT_ACK_REQ or FRAGMENT_ACK_RES depends on
   whether a peer is acknowledging an IKEv2 request or a response.

3.1.  Sending Fragment Acknowledgment response

   The responder MAY send a response to an exchange with Fragment
   Acknowledgment notification after receiving one or more fragments of
   a request.  See Figure 1.  Similarly, the initiator MAY send a
   Fragment Acknowledgment notification after receiving one or more
   fragments of a response.  See Figure 2.

   When the initiator sends a FRAGMENT_ACK_RES notification in response
   to a fragmented response, it MUST set the IKE header Response (R)
   bit.  This results in a message that is technically a “response to a
   response” and reuses the same Message ID, which is unusual in IKEv2.
   However, the notifier is distinct FRAGMENT_ACK_RES.  This message is
   informational in nature, does not advance the Message ID state, and
   does not require a response.

3.2.  Processing Fragment Acknowledgment Message

   Unlike typical IKEv2 exchanges, which complete when a response with
   the matching Message ID arrives, Fragment Acknowledgment notification
   do not indicate completion of the exchange.  Instead, this message
   requests retransmission of the missing fragments and MUST NOT advance
   the IKEv2 Message ID counter.

   When the sender retransmits in response to a Fragment Acknowledgment,
   it SHOULD begin with the lowest missing fragment.  (See editor’s note
   below regarding potential use of INFORMATIONAL exchanges.)

4.  Negotiation

   The use of Fragment Acknowledgment MUST be negotiated during the
   IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  Both the initiator and the responder indicate
   support for this extension by including the FRAGMENT_ACK_SUPPORTED
   Notify Message Status Type (value TBD1) in the IKE_SA_INIT request
   and response messages.  The presence of this notification in both
   directions confirms that both peers support the Fragment
   Acknowledgment mechanism.  In addition, both peers MUST also signal
   support for IKEv2 Fragmentation by sending the
   IKEV2_FRAGMENTATION_SUPPORTED notification as specified in
   Section 2.3 Negotiation of [RFC7383].

Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment        December 2025


   If either peer omits the FRAGMENT_ACK_SUPPORTED notification in
   IKE_SA_INIT the extension MUST NOT be used in subsequent exchanges
   within that IKE SA.

   The FRAGMENT_ACK_SUPPORTED notification follows the general rules for
   Notify Message Status Types as specified in [RFC7296], Section 3.10.
   It does not include any data in the Notification Data field.

5.  Backward Compatibility

   Receipt of a FRAGMENT_ACK_REQ or FRAGMENT_ACK_RES notification MUST
   NOT be interpreted as advancing the IKEv2 exchange state.  Instead it
   is signal to retransmit only the missing fragments.  It MUST only be
   sent after both peers have indicated support for
   FRAGMENT_ACK_SUPPORTED.

6.  Operational Considerations

   The FRAGMENT_ACK notification message SHOULD NOT be large enough to
   cause path-MTU issues.  If the number of acknowledged fragments
   results in a payload that approaches the path MTU or the IKEv2
   fragment size, the sender MAY limit the number of missing fragment
   ranges included in a single message and send multiple FRAGMENT_ACK
   messages if necessary.  Implementations SHOULD ensure that each
   FRAGMENT_ACK message fits within a single UDP datagram to avoid IP-
   layer fragmentation.

   When the sender receives multiple FRAGMENT_ACK messages, the sender
   treats the union of all ranges acknowledged so far as the
   authoritative view.

6.1.  When to Send a Fragment Acknowledgment

   Since the IKEv2 retransmission model is sender-driven, the responder
   SHOULD be conservative about when to send the first FRAGMENT_ACK
   message.  A responder MAY send a FRAGMENT_ACK only after it detects
   that the sender has retransmitted at least one fragment of the same
   message, indicating that one or more fragments were likely lost.  In
   general, an IKE peer sending a FRAGMENT_ACK message SHOULD do so only
   when it can provide useful information about missing fragments, in
   order to avoid unnecessary traffic and message processing overhead
   and to remain consistent with the sender-driven retransmission model
   of IKEv2.  However, with large number of fragments this may take long
   time to converge.

Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgment        December 2025


6.2.  IV reuse when using AEAD

   One potential implementation issue I can see with these ACKs is the
   IV when using AEAD.  Both the request and the response use the same
   Message ID as the actual messages more than once.  If the IKEv2
   Message ID is used as IV this would lead to reuse of IV.  Which MUST
   be avoided.

6.3.  Update to RFC7383

   [RFC7383] specifies that when an IKE message is retransmitted, all
   fragments of that message, including the first fragment, MUST be
   retransmitted.  The selective retransmission enabled by the
   FRAGMENT_ACK mechanism defined in this document relaxes that
   requirement by allowing the sender to retransmit only the fragments
   that the peer identifies as missing.  Accordingly, this document
   updates [RFC7383] by modifying the retransmission behavior specified
   in Section 2.6.  When FRAGMENT_ACK is negotiated, a sender MAY
   retransmit only the fragments indicated as missing by the peer,
   rather than retransmitting all fragments including fragment number 1.

   Section 4 of [RFC7383] should be updated to allow fragment
   acknowledgment.

7.  Editors Notes Open Issues

   *  Path MTU discovery mentioned in [RFC7383] is currently ignored;
      applicability TBD.

   *  When fragments exceed the path MTU, they may not be acknowledged,
      and the IKE state will not advance.  This will have re-fragmented
      as specified in [RFC7383]

   *  Why not use IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL?  That may adhere more to IKEv2.
      However, every INFORMATIONAL needs a response.  And if there is no
      response the INFORMATIONAL message MUST be retransmitted to
      advance IKE state.  This would lead to complex unpredictable
      retransmissions.

   *  Why not make new IKEv2 exchange without a response?  Instead of
      responding to the same : responding with IKE_AUTH or
      IKE_INTERMEDIATE This is worth considering.  New Exchange
      IKE_FRAG_ACK : which has no response.  The message will carry IKE
      exchange and message ID it is responding to.  This might be bigger
      change.  This will be a bigger protocol change.  Probably too
      complicated?

   *  Should every acknowledgment sent by an IKE peer MUST include the
      entire state of the buffer.  That is, acknowledgments are
      cumulative.  However, when the entire state does not
      conservatively fit into one packet FRAGMENT_ACK message would be
      partial.

   *  Rename ACK to NACK? -ve acknowledgment?  May be later?

7.1.  New Exchange: IKE_FRAG_ACK?

   A possible design alternative is to define a new IKEv2 exchange type,
   IKE_FRAG_ACK, which carries fragment acknowledgment information but
   does not have a response.  Each IKE_FRAG_ACK message would include
   the Exchange Type and Message ID of the IKE message it acknowledges.
   This exchange has no response specified.  It is one shot message.
   This approach would decouple fragment acknowledgment from existing
   IKE exchanges such as IKE_AUTH, IKE_INTERMEDIATE or CREATE_CHILD_SA.

7.2.  Why not TCP?

   Reliable transport for IKEv2 over TCP, as proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-reliable-transport], adds implementation
   complexity and resource cost.  It requires maintaining both TCP and
   UDP sockets, increasing energy use on low-powered devices.  Using TCP
   for IKE while keeping ESP in UDP mode through NAT gateways introduces
   additional state and resource requirements.  It may also be less
   compatible with hardware offloading and inefficient for low-power or
   mobile platforms.

   Antony's position is that using TCP for IKEv2 is not an ideal
   solution for improving reliability.  While a UDP based ideas borrowed
   from QUIC-based could provide reliable transport and may be one day
   congestion control!  It would be complex for the limited goal of
   fragment acknowledgment and selective retransmission.  Other authors
   may have different views on this topic.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Message Status Types" registry.
