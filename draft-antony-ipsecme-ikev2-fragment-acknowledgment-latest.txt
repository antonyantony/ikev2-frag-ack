                IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgemnt Extension
         draft-antony-ipsecme-ikev2-fragment-acknowledgment-01

Abstract

   *Abstract* This document specifies an extension to the Internet Key
   Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) that introduces acknowledgment
   for IKEv2 message fragments.  The mechanism allows an endpoint to
   confirm reception of individual fragments during the IKE_AUTH
   exchange and subsequent exchanges.  This improves reliability when
   large IKE messages are exchanged, such as those containing post-
   quantum cryptography (PQC) payloads, and reduces retransmission
   overhead to improve PQC IKEv2 exchange round-trip times in lossy
   networks.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296] uses
   an unreliable transport (UDP) for message exchange.

   Originally, IKEv2 messages were small enough that a simple
   fragmentation[RFC7383] and retransmission mechanism, operating over
   UDP without congestion control or partial acknowledgments, was
   practically sufficient.  However, with the introduction of post-
   quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms into IKEv2 [RFC9370], IKE
   peers are now required to exchange much larger messages than those
   produced by classical algorithms â€” often tens or even kilobytes.

   Several proposals have been made to overcome the 64-kilobyte
   limitation on the size of an IKE payload ([I-D.nir-ipsecme-big-
   payload], [I-D.smyslov-ipsecme-ikev2-extended-pld], [I-D.tjhai-ikev2-
   beyond-64k-limit]).

   In the current IKEv2 fragmentation mechanism [RFC7383], when one or
   more fragments are lost, the sender retransmits all fragments of the
   message.  Practical experience shows that this can lead to
   significant retransmission overhead and long delays when large
   fragmented messages are exchanged.  This document proposes a fragment
   acknowledgment mechanism for IKEv2, similar in concept to
   acknowledgment schemes used in QUIC, [RFC9001] to improve reliability
   and efficiency.  When #+BEGIN_EXPORT ascii initiator peer rececee the
   new IKEv2 fragment acknowledgment message it MAY retransmit only the
   missing fragments. #+END_EXPORT

Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgemnt         October 2025


1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4301]:
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), Security Association (SA),
   Security Policy Database (SPD).

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *Usecae Reliable transport for IKEv2 over TCP
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-reliable-transport].

3.  IKEv2 Fragment Acknowledgemnt

   The Fragment Acknowledgemnt is most useful during IKE_AUTH and
   IKE_INTERMEDIATE and CREATE_CHILD_SA.  During the IKE_AUTH and likely
   during IKE_INTERMEDIATE peer authentication is not complete.  During
   IKE_AUTH exchange, IKE Fragment messages are cryptographically
   protected, SK_a and SK_e must already be calculated.  The format of
   the fragment is speicied in [RFC7383]

3.1.  Fragment message format.

   The responder can only acknowledge fragments after it receive the
   first fragement.

   If the sender is retrasmitting it should start with fragment one
   until it receive an acknowledgment from the receiver it received the
   first fragment.

   Initialy thoughts are to allign frament format similar to QUIC
   [RFC9001]

4.  Operational Considerations

   Message scalability for large number of nodes in the group think of
   thousands to possibly millions of nodes.  Number of messages
   exchanges to derive unique key.

5.  Acknowledgments

   ACKs TBD
